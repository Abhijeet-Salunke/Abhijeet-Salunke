## About Me

I am an Assistant System Engineer, working as a Java Developer with hands-on experience in Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL, along with using Postman for API testing. Passionate about designing scalable and efficient systems, I aspire to grow into a System Designer role. Alongside my professional work, I actively enhance my skills as a competitive programmer, practicing Data Structures and Algorithms on LeetCode to sharpen my logical thinking and coding proficiency.
