## About Me

I am an Assistant System Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), working as a Java Developer with hands-on experience in Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL, along with using Postman for API testing. Passionate about designing scalable and efficient systems, I aspire to grow into a System Designer role, where I can leverage my technical expertise and problem-solving mindset to build impactful solutions. Alongside my professional work, I actively enhance my skills as a competitive programmer, practicing Data Structures and Algorithms on LeetCode to sharpen my logical thinking and coding proficiency. I thrive in challenging environments that push me to learn, innovate, and contribute to high-quality software development.
